## Introduction

Azure Copilot leverages natural language processing to interact with your APIs, allowing end users to perform complex operations with simple, intuitive commands. This document details how to integrate an API service with Azure Copilot—from initial design through secure registration and on-going optimization. The aim is to empower your applications with powerful AI-driven assistance that reduces coding overhead and streamlines operations.

## Architecture Overview

The integration is built on three fundamental components:

- **API Development:** Create robust, RESTful APIs described by an OpenAPI specification.
- **Plugin Manifest:** Develop a detailed manifest file that instructs Azure Copilot about your API’s structure, endpoints, and authentication methods.
- **Azure Registration:** Register and configure your API in Azure so that Copilot can interact with it effectively.

This architecture ensures that natural language queries are mapped accurately to concrete API operations, making your system robust and user-friendly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have:
- An active **Azure Subscription**.
- A **RESTful API** ready for integration (or in development), with endpoints that perform functions you want to expose via natural language.
- An **OpenAPI (Swagger)** specification file which documents your API endpoints, parameters, and responses.
- Development tools such as **Visual Studio Code** equipped with Azure and GitHub Copilot extensions.

## Developing Your API

### Creating an OpenAPI Specification

Your API should be described by an OpenAPI spec. This specification acts as a contract between your API and Azure Copilot, detailing how endpoints behave.

Example of a simple OpenAPI snippet (YAML):

```yaml
openapi: "3.0.0"
info:
  title: Sample API
  version: "1.0.0"
paths:
  /charge:
    post:
      summary: "Charge an amount from the designated budget"
      requestBody:
        description: "Details of the charge"
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              properties:
                amount:
                  type: number
                description:
                  type: string
      responses:
        '200':
          description: "Charge processed successfully"
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  status:
                    type: string
                  transactionId:
                    type: string
